## A best system should have a user-friendly interaction mode
People used to promote iOS as the most suitable mobile system for interaction and it has reached the people hope for a long time.But after years of stagnation, the Android system is likely to be more user-friendly than ios system.Take the return function as an example,you can perform left and right strokes on the edge of screen to return in Android or you can use "Three major buttons" as a more traditional way.But in iOS,you need to touch the return arrow on upper left corner,which is so distant.
## A best system should have a concise and efficient UI design
In this field, iOS continues to be a leader and has always been an example for Android.The Android UIs like MIUI have been imitating this design for so long.

This design clearly informs you of its function, without unnecessary features, making the learning system easier to use, more efficient to operate, and happier to watch and work with it.  
## A best system should be able to accept some neccesary user customization.
This thing is simple.The iOS system cannot use custom ringtones, lacks call recording, cannot use the Application dual open and Long screenshot.Although these functions may be small, they often affect your use and even disrupt your mood.
