Good evening everyone,

Today, I would like to address the issue of the high cost of new fabric that our company has been facing. After conducting a market research report, I found that several suppliers' quotations were higher. If materials are purchased at this price, the expected profit cannot be achieved. This issue has been causing a major setback to our production process, and I am here to propose a solution.

As for the traditional way, we can negotiate with the fabric suppliers or conduct a bidding process to ensure we get the best deal possible. This will not only help us lower the cost but also strengthen our business relationship with the suppliers.

To take it a step further, if we purchase in larger quantities or engage in joint development, we may be able to lower the price.This will not only help us reduce costs but also create opportunities for collaboration with the suppliers, leading to long-term partnerships.

In conclusion, by negotiating or conducting a bidding process, we can lower the cost of the new fabric, ensuring the smooth running of our production process. And with the scarcity of the goods, we should make a quick decision in order to get the fabric in time.Surely, the time is money.
